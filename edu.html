        <p style="text-align: justify; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How high are dropout rates to be checked?</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">To check dropout rates, one can do the following:</p>
        <ol style="text-align: justify;;">
            <li><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Look for official government reports:</strong>  Many governments release reports on school enrollment and dropout rates at different levels of education. These reports are often found on government websites or through a Freedom of Information Act request.</li><br>
            <li><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Check with educational institutions:</strong>   Schools, colleges, and universities may also have data on dropout rates. One can contact them directly or check their websites to see if they have published this information.</li><br>
            <li><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Conduct surveys:</strong>  One can also conduct surveys of students who have left school or college to determine their reasons for dropping out. This can be done through phone, email, or in-person interviews.</li><br>
            <li><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Analyze existing data:</strong> Researchers and analysts may already have compiled data on dropout rates, which can be accessed through academic journals, research databases, or other online sources.</li><br>
        </ol>
        <p style="text-align: justify;text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Who drops out more, and at what level of education?</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Dropout rates vary by region, socio-economic status, gender, and level of education in India. However, girls generally tend to drop out of school more often than boys due to early marriage, domestic responsibilities, and safety concerns. Additionally, students from lower socio-economic backgrounds are more likely to drop out due to financial constraints or the need to work to support their families.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Boys’ and girls’ dropout rates are relatively low at the primary level (grades 1-5). However, at the upper primary level (grades 6-8), the same for girls is higher than that of boys, particularly in rural areas. At the secondary level (grades 9-10), the overall dropout rate increases for both genders, with girls having a slightly higher rate than boys.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, addressing the underlying causes of dropout rates requires a multi-pronged approach, including improving the quality of education, increasing access to education, addressing socio-economic disparities, and promoting gender equality.</p><br>
        <p style="text-align: justify;text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What are the causes of high dropout rates?</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">There are multiple causes of dropout rates in India, which vary depending on the specific context and region. Some common reasons for high dropout rates in India include:</p>
        <ol style="text-align: justify;">
            <li><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Economic factors:</strong>  Many children come from low-income families and are forced to drop out of school due to financial constraints. Families often need their children to work to support the household.</li><br>
            <li><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Poor infrastructure: </strong>  Lack of basic amenities such as clean water, sanitation, and transportation to schools can contribute to high dropout rates.</li><br>
            <li><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Social factors:</strong>  In some cases, social norms and gender biases prevent girls from continuing their education. Child marriage is also a significant cause of girls dropping out of school.</li><br>
            <li><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Poor quality of education:</strong>  Inadequate resources, untrained teachers, and outdated teaching methods can lead to a lack of interest among students and high dropout rates.</li><br>
            <li><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Health-related issues:</strong>  Poor health, lack of access to healthcare facilities, and frequent illnesses can cause students to miss school, leading to a higher likelihood of dropping out.</li><br>
            <li><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Distance to school:</strong>  Many children live in rural areas and have to travel long distances to reach school, which can be a significant barrier to regular attendance.</li><br>
            <li><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Lack of parental involvement:</strong>  In a few cases, parents might not be aware of the importance of education, or they may not be involved enough in their children’s education, leading to a lack of motivation among students.</li><br>
        </ol>
        <p style="text-align: justify;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Reasons For Dropout</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">According to various reports and studies, some reasons for dropout out of school in India include poverty, lack of access to quality education, inadequate school infrastructure and resources, social and cultural norms, child labor, early marriage, and gender inequality.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">The government and other stakeholders need to address these issues through various initiatives such as providing financial assistance and incentives for families to keep their children in school, improving the quality of education, building more schools and infrastructure, and promoting gender equality and awareness about the importance of education.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Initiatives such as Samagra Shiksha and the Right to Education Act have been implemented to tackle these issues and improve access to education for all children in India.</p><br>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What efforts are being made in India to improve these rates?</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">India has made significant efforts to improve school education and achieve universalization of education. Following are the recently initiatied by the government of India:</p>
